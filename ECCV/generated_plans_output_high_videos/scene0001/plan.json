    "scene_description": "The environment is a large, carpeted common room or lounge area, possibly in an office or a university building. The space is furnished with multiple pieces of brown leather-like seating, including several two-seater sofas and numerous single-person armchairs. There are also at least three coffee tables of two different styles: some are dark wood, while others are a lighter, reddish-colored wood. The furniture is arranged into several disparate, somewhat disorganized conversational groupings. One section of the room features green cabinetry and a countertop, resembling a small kitchenette or break area, with trash and recycling bins nearby. A whiteboard on an easel stands against one wall, suggesting the space could be used for meetings or presentations. The overall state is somewhat untidy, with furniture arrangements that do not optimize the space for a single, clear purpose, and a red backpack is left on one of the armchairs.",
