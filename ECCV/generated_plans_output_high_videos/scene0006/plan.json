    "scene_description": "The video tour depicts a furnished hotel room with a somewhat lived-in and cluttered state. The room contains two large beds with white linens, a wooden desk with a rolling chair, and a separate seating area. This area includes two upholstered armchairs, a small round table, and a dresser with a television on it. An open suitcase and some bags are on the floor near one of the beds, obstructing the walkway. One of the armchairs is covered with a pile of clothes, and the small table is cluttered. The room is illuminated by warm lamplight and natural light from a window covered by curtains. The overall layout suggests a space used for both rest and work, which is currently in need of tidying and reconfiguration for relaxation.",
