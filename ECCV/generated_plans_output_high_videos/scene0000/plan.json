    "scene_description": "The scene is a multi-functional open-plan living space, likely a studio apartment, with distinct zones for living, sleeping, and cooking. The living area features a large blue L-shaped sofa with an ottoman, a large wooden entertainment center with bookshelves, and a breakfast bar with stools. The flooring is white tile. A bicycle is parked near the sofa, creating an obstruction. The bedroom area, set on a large rug, contains a bed with a backpack and helmet on it, a wooden computer desk with an office chair, a white bedside table, and a small side table. A guitar on a stand is located in the walkway between the bedroom area and a bathroom. The kitchen area includes wooden cabinetry, a refrigerator, a microwave, and a countertop. A trash can is visible near an exterior door. An open doorway reveals a bathroom with a sink, toilet, and shower. The overall state of the apartment is lived-in and somewhat cluttered with personal items and recreational gear not in designated storage areas.",
