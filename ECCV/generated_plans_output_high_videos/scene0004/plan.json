    "scene_description": "The scene is a modern, brightly-lit open-plan office common area or breakout space, situated on an upper level overlooking a floor below. The area features blue and grey patterned carpeting. The space is furnished with highly mobile, modular furniture, all equipped with caster wheels. This includes a large rectangular table with a light wood top and metal frame, two black mesh-backed office chairs, a series of low-profile modular armless chairs (some with blue backs, some all black), and a separate nook with a high-backed grey lounge chair and a small round side table. The space is defined by a white safety railing on one side and a floor-to-ceiling glass wall on the other.",
