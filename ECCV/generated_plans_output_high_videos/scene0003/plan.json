    "scene_description": "The scene is a small office kitchenette or breakroom. It is equipped with standard amenities including wooden cabinetry, dark countertops, a stainless steel sink, a black refrigerator, a microwave situated in a built-in shelf, and a freestanding water cooler. The room has a cork-tile floor and white walls. The space is in a state of mild disarray: a grey trash can is overflowing with paper towels and cups, a stray paper towel sits on the counter beside it, and a backpack is on the floor near the doorway, partially obstructing the entrance. The room appears functional but requires cleaning and organization to be fully usable and tidy.",
