    "scene_description": "The scene is a single, multi-functional room, likely a dorm or studio apartment, which serves as a living and entertainment area. The room is carpeted in dark green, with a bright orange shag rug defining the central seating space. Furniture includes a small grey tufted sofa, a large green ottoman acting as a coffee table, and two wooden-framed armchairs. An entertainment center is set up with a television on a low media console. Other notable items include a brick fireplace (which appears unused), a small kitchenette-like corner with a white shelving unit holding a coffee maker and kettle, a white wardrobe, a separate black cabinet with a microwave and printer, a pedestal fan, and a small, mobile laptop table. The overall arrangement feels cluttered and not optimized for social gathering or media consumption.",
