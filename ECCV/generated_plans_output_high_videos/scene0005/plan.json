    "scene_description": "The scene is a modern study or small library common area, characterized by its functional furniture and layout. The room has striped carpeting and a combination of light gray, tan, and lime green walls. A large, dark wood table with an integrated power outlet serves as the centerpiece, paired with a long, built-in wooden bench on one side. Several bright green chairs with patterned cushions are positioned around the table, some tucked in and some pulled out. Against a tan wall, a large television is mounted above a small wooden cabinet. In one corner, near a doorway, stands a wheeled library book cart filled with textbooks. The area appears organized but configured for individual or small group work at the table, not for a presentation.",
